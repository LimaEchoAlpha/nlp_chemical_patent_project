### Exploring BERT Architechtures for Relation Extraction of Chemical Patents

#### W266 Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning
#### Fall 2021 Final Project

Abstract

Novel chemistries developed outside of academia are often only published in patents, but patents are written for the purpose of protecting intellectual property, so they can be challenging to parse for relevant information.  This project focuses on the relation extraction subtask of extracting the synthesis process of new chemical compounds from patent snippets.  It explores different combinations of input and output representations for BERT models in order to understand which architectures are most effective for classifying relations from chemical patents.
