The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and then the resulting residue was purified by flash column chromatography MeOH CH2Cl2 =298 . The resulting fraction was concentrated under reduced pressure and then further under vacuum . As a result 70.0 mg of R33methyl7Hpyrrolo23dpyrimidine4ylaminopiperidine1ylsulfonylbenzonitrile was obtained with a yield of about 59.3% .
